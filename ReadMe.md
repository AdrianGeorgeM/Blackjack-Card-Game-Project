# Simple Python Blackjack Game ♠️ ♥️ ♣️ ♦️

This is a simple text-based Blackjack game implemented in Python. It's designed to be a basic demonstration of how the game works and has been developed as part of my learning journey in Python programming.

## Game Features 🎲

1. The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards. The cards are shuffled before each game.
2. The player and dealer are dealt two cards each at the start of the game.
3. The player can choose to 'hit' (receive another card) or 'stay' (end their turn).
4. The dealer must 'hit' until they have 17 or more.
5. The game handles 'busts' (when the total of a hand exceeds 21), 'blackjacks' (an Ace and a 10-value card as the first two cards), and normal game endings according to standard Blackjack rules.

## How to Play 🕹️

1. Run the `blackjack.py` Python file.
2. You'll see your two cards and one of the dealer's cards.
3. You'll be asked whether you want to 'hit' or 'stay'. If you want to 'hit', enter 'h'. If you want to 'stay', enter 's'.
4. The game continues until you 'bust', 'stay', or get a 'blackjack'.
5. After you 'stay', it's the dealer's turn. The dealer will 'hit' until they have 17 or more.
6. The game ends and the winner is announced.
